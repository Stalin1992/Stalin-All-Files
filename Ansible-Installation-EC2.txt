Steps to setup Ansible Control Servers and Clients

If AMI is Amazon Linux2 (only in control server)

sudo yum update -y (server and client)

# this command needs to be run only on master

sudo amazon-linux-extras install ansible2

ansible --version

Create a new user for ansible administration & grant admin access to user (Master and Slave)

sudo useradd ansadmin
sudo passwd ansadmin


 below command addes ansadmin to sudoers file. But strongly recommended to use "visudo" command if you are aware vi or nano editor. 

as root
visudo

add this line in the last

ansadmin	ALL=(ALL)	NOPASSWD:ALL

vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

comment PasswordAuthentication no
uncomment PasswordAuthentication yes

(important in master and slave)
restart the sshd service
sudo service sshd restart

Login as a ansadmin user on master and generate ssh key (Master)

ssh-keygen
Copy keys onto all ansible client nodes (Master)

ssh-copy-id <target-server>
Update target servers information on /etc/ansible/hosts file (Master)

cd /etc/ansible
vi hosts

echo "<target server IP>" > /etc/ansible/hosts
Run ansible command as ansadmin user it should be successful (Master)

ansible all -m ping

commands:
ansible -m copy -a "src=/home/ansadmin/first.txt dest=/home/ansadmin" all_host

installaing httpd in remote

ansible  -b -K  -m  yum -a "name=httpd state=latest" all_host (with pwd)

ansible  -b -m  yum -a "name=httpd state=latest" all_host (without pwd)
